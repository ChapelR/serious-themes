## Contributing Themes 

Feel free to fix up things via pull requests or let me know about stuff via issues. 

If you want to contribute themes, you can edit your `theme.css` file to your liking, then send me a link or the file. If you send me a file, let me know how you're licensing it, how you want to be credited, and what your theme should be called.
